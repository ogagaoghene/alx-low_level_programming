# Dynamic libraries 

## Description
Dynamic libaries provide a means to use code that can be loaded anywhere in the memory. 
Once loaded, the library code can be used by any number of programs. 
This way the size of programs using dynamic library and the memory footprint can be kept low as a lot of code is kept common in form of a shared library.
